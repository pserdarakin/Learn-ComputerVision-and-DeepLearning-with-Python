# Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning Coursework

This repository contains the coursework and projects I completed while taking the "Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning" course on Udemy. The course provided an in-depth introduction to computer vision using Python and OpenCV, along with an exploration of deep learning concepts applied to image processing.

## Modules Covered

- **NumPy and Image Basics**: Introduction to NumPy arrays and image representation.
- **Image Basics with OpenCV**: Fundamental operations on images like reading, writing, and displaying images using OpenCV.
- **Image Processing**: Advanced image processing techniques such as transformations, filtering, and histograms.
- **Video Basics**: Handling and manipulating video streams with OpenCV.
- **Object Detection**: Detecting objects in images using pre-trained models.
- **Object Tracking**: Implementing object tracking algorithms.
- **Deep Learning Computer Vision**: Utilizing deep learning models for advanced computer vision tasks.

## Projects

The projects within this repository serve as practical applications of the concepts covered in each module. They include:

- Real-time video processing
- Object detection in images and video streams
- Implementing CNNs for image classification

## Installation and Usage

Each project folder contains a separate README with installation instructions and usage examples. Generally, to run these projects, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow (for deep learning modules)

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib tensorflow
```
